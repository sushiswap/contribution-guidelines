# Contribution Guidelines


### Workflow

1. Fork and clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/SUSHI_REPONAME.git
    ```

1. Create a branch in the fork

    The branch should be based on the `master` branch in the master repository. Prepend the correct [type](#type) to your branch.

    ```sh
    git checkout -b TYPE/my-feature-or-bugfix master
    ```

1. Commit changes on your branch

    Commit changes to your branch, following the commit message format.

    ```sh
    git commit -m "properly formatted SET statements."
    ```

1. Push the changes to your fork

    ```sh
    git push -u myfork TYPE/my-feature-or-bugfix
    ```

1. Create a Pull Request

    In the Github UI of your fork, create a Pull Request to the `master` branch of the master repository.

    If the branch has merge conflicts or has been outdated, please do a rebase against the `master` branch.


### <a name="commit"></a> Commit message guidelines

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

#### <a name="type"></a> Type

Should be one of the following:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **chore:** Changes to build and dev processes/tools
- **docs:** Changes to documentation
- **style:** Changes to code style formatting (white space, commas etc)

#### Scope

The `<scope>` of the commit is optional and can be omitted. When used though, it should describe the place or part of the project, e.g. `docs(examples)`, `feat(data)` etc.
